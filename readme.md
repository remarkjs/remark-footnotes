# remark-footnotes

**Stability: Legacy**.
This package is no longer recommended for use.
It’s still covered by semantic-versioning guarantees and not yet deprecated,
but use of this package should be avoided.
Please use [`remark-gfm`][gfm] instead.
That package match how footnotes work on github.com, which is more likely
to match the expectations of your authors.

Legacy [documentation for this
package](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-footnotes/tree/cab264b)
is still available in Git.
