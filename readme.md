# remark-footnotes

Deprecated: this package is no longer maintained.
Please use [`remark-gfm`][gfm] instead.
That package match how footnotes work on github.com,
which is more likely to match the expectations of authors.

[Git][] is still intact and previous versions can still be used without warnings.
